    <p>We are a family of Mexicans proud of the crafts of their country.</p>
    <p>Jásï was created in 2021 by the GP family, with the purpose of helping its customers find <strong><em>unique and original mexican pieces</strong> of garments, accesories, jewerly and decor</em>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>We work with a group of artisans throughout the Mexican Republic</strong></em> with whom we make the different pieces. Each of these pieces are unique for the most part, as <em>each craftsman plays with his own techniques and imagination</em>.</p>
    <p>This alliance has allowed us to help many families to have a secure income through the fair sale for their admirable work.</p>
